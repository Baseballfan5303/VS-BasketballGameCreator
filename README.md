# VS-BasketballGameCreator
An app allowing a user to play a basketball game based on if they make or miss a given shot upon entering lineups of their choice.

# Content within this Github:
A folder containing all the XAML & C# files I used to create the Windows version (Mobile soon).
The most important file: !CreatorInfo which details all screens, game directions, caveats, etc.
More to come!
