Hi everyone,

If you are here, I want to say thank you for downloading my app!

1. Note that this is my first time publishing an app and so there many be bugs, irregular formatting, and annoying caveats I want to quick go over so this app is as smooth as possible for everyone!
2. Directions - Use the buttons included in the app to navigate between four different screens (Title, Set Lineups/Rosters, Basketball Game, Game Log). You will enter your own players into the lineup spots and use the make/miss shot/free throws to simulate a real basketball game!
3. This game has been designed for those who practice basketball and want to see how a real game might go based on their shooting performance. The app will give you a shot to make upon starting it, and you click the corresponding button to tell the app if you made the shot or not (more details below.

Title Screen:
- Well if you got here, you mastered 1/2 of the title page! The other 1/2 is a button to send you to the set lineups screen.

Set Lineups/Rosters Screen:
* Use the text boxes to enter players of your choice!
**PLEASE BE SURE THE TEAMS YOU USE EACH HAVE MORE THAN 3 CHARACTERS IN THEIR NAME! This is an issue I plan on correcting in the near future! If your team name is only one or two characters long, the program will crash!
*** PLEASE FILL OUT THE FIRST 5 SPOTS FOR EACH TEAM! This to make sure you do not get any blank/null replacements or even crashes. Thank you and I plan to fix any problem users may have with this in the future.
**** IF YOU PLAN ON USING BENCH PLAYERS, please be sure to fill out every single textbox! This to make sure you do not get any blank/null replacements or even crashes. Thank you and I plan to fix any problem users may have with this in the future. YOU ONLY NEED TO FILL OUT SPOTS 6-10 FOR BENCH...11 & 12 are irrelevant (for now..I will implement those reserve spots in the future).
*****Be sure to select either FREE THROWS or NO FREE THROWS (the app will tell you your selection under the drop-down) and ENTER THE AMOUNT OF MINUTES EACH QUARTER LASTS FOR! (Ex. Type 3 in the text box, NOT 3 minutes.) 
- Once you have filled everything out, click the button to start the game!

Basketball Game Screen {NO FREE THROWS}: 
****** Begin the game by clicking the "Start Q1" button on the bottom-left of your screen! NOTICE THE GAME GENERATES A SHOT FOR YOU TO MAKE! You do not need to follow this, but it adds a fun element within the app!
- Top - Scoreboard: Away Team Score, Quarter Number and Time Left, Home Team Score
- Middle - Buttons to bring in a team for away/home team, A PICTURE OF A BASKETBALL COURT TO TELL YOU WHERE TO SHOOT THE BALL 
- Middle/Bottom - Buttons: *!*! RED (left) = MISS, GREEN (right) = MAKE !*!*
- Below that - The action bar! This will be the text block which tells you, the user, what occurs in your game! A second one will occur if a player got an offensive rebound (this is so the game seems realistic). IF THE SECOND BAR POPS UP, IT WILL BE ON THE BOTTOM...TAKE THE SHOT IT TELLS YOU TO ABOVE IT.
- Bottom - Four buttons to begin each quarter, a BOX TO SHOW WHICH PLAYERS ARE ON THE FLOOR, and a button to end the game!
******* To begin the game, again, click the Start Q1 Button...click the Start Q2 Button when it says "Q1 Done." at the top and so on and so forth.
 
Basketball Game Screen {FREE THROWS}:
*Everything is the same as the No Free Throws except:
- Two more colored buttons were added! *!*! LIGHTPINK (far-left) = MISS FREE THROW, LIGHTGREEN (far-right) = MADE FREE THROW !*!*
**USE THESE BUTTONS ONLY WHEN THE SECOND ACTION BAR TELLS YOU THAT A PLAYER GOT FREE THROWS. IGNORE THE SHOT GIVEN WHEN YOUR PLAYER GOT FREE THROWS.

Game Log Screen:
*** On this screen, you will see all the actions that happened in your game! You can enter extra notes at the top to be saved with your game log, but this is completely optional.
**** Click the button at the bottom to save. NOTE: You might need to give the app permission to save the game log. To do this, navigate to Settings >> Storage/Apps >> BasketballGameCreator >> Permissions >> Check the circle/box that says "Storage."
---------ON ANDROID: The files currently save to your Storage >> Documents or Downloads. To access your file upon saving, on your device, navigate to: Settings >> Storage >> Documents or Downloads -OR- My Files or Files >> Documents or Downloads
**** If the files do not show up right away upon closing the app or just saving the file, do not worry, they should appear within a day or two. 

*CAVEATS AND CREATOR NOTES:*
--------------------------
This is the most important part of this doc for me, so please read this as well.

1. Again, if you plan on using bench players, please fill out SPOTS 1-10 in the set lineups screen! This is to ensure the app does not crash and that you do not get any blank-named players (I will fix this in the future if it is a bad problem!).

2. Again, PLEASE BE SURE THE TEAMS YOU USE EACH HAVE MORE THAN 3 CHARACTERS IN THEIR NAME! This is an issue I plan on correcting in the near future! If your team name is only one or two characters long, the program will crash!

3. Be sure to give the app permission to save your game log (if you desire). Check out the third point I make in the section I have titled "Game Log Screen" up above on how to do so.

4. Future Ideas: Users can import lineups using a .txt file, you can choose who to replace who, and to make a real product which omits the user from having to click the strike/ball buttons (maybe a camera can tell the app if the user makes the shot or not...).
